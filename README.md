# Abyss Client Source
This is the full source code of Abyss!
Enjoy using it however you want!

## Additional Information
1. Because everyone keeps saying im ratting, go search your rat in this source and show me ðŸ˜‚.
2. This client is using a base called "Skidware" made by "Smellon" also known as "johncbranton".
3. This Client is my first Injection Client this is why its really bad and like 80% skidded from Smellon.
4. This Client is coded in CLion 2024.1 using the Microsoft Visual Studio Toolchains with CMake.
5. This Client is likley to have huge memory leaks, so it will be cool if someone fixes them.
6. For more information on how to setup CLion with CMake is here: (CLion-DLL-AutoClicker-Example)[https://github.com/SleepyFish-YT/CLion-DLL-AutoClicker-Example/blob/main/README.md]
